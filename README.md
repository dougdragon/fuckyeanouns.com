fuckyeahnouns clone
==================

A clone of fuckyeahnouns

I just played around with Flask / Bottle and wanted to code up something quick so decided to make a small clone of the imfamous fuckyeahnouns.com. I'll be adding more to it as I figure out more stuffs.

Have an idea that'll point me in a better direction? Send it or make a pull request. I love to learn.

<strong>To run:</strong><br />
install the requirements - pip install -r requirements.txt<br />
run: python fuckyeah.py<br />
Open browser to http://localhost:5000
