fuckyeahnouns clone
==================

A clone of <a href="http://fuckyeahnouns.com">fuckyeahnouns</a>

I just played around with Flask / Bottle and wanted to code up something quick so decided to make a small clone of the imfamous <a href="http://fuckyeahnouns.com">fuckyeahnouns.com</a>. I'll be adding more to it as I figure out more stuffs.

Have an idea that'll point me in a better direction? Send it or make a pull request. I love to learn.

<strong>To run:</strong><br />
<ol>
<li>install the requirements - pip install -r requirements.txt<br /></li>
<li>run: python fuckyeah.py<br /></li>
<li>Open browser to http://localhost:5000</li>
</ol>
